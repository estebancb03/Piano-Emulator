## Note

This class is used to encapsulate the necessary elements to adequately represent a note, both in its logical and graphical parts. The properties of this class store the JPanel to represent the note in the frame, the color of the JPanel, the x and y position in which the JPanel is going to be located and the intensity of the note. The Note class is implemented in Java as follows:

``` java
public class Note {
  private Color color;
  private JPanel panel;
  private int x;
  private int y;
  private int intensity;
}
```
